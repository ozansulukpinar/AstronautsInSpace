This is a .NET Core Console Application project. When the application is run, a message will display about current ISS location and also number and name of people in space. All data get from an open-source API that called as Open Notify was developed by Nathan Bergey.

To develop this console application, I used Visual Studio Code. That was the first time for me.

For this project, I have just installed packages RestSharp and Newtonsoft.Json from NuGet.
